Project Specification: Security-outcome (API Security Playground)

1. Project Overview:
 Objective: Create a secure API with a PostgreSQL database that serves as a controlled environment for testing SQL injection vulnerabilities.
 Technology Stack: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL.

2. Catalog Structure:
* Server:
  - App.js: Main server file.
* Frontend:
  - react/: Production-ready React app.
  - dev/: Development version of the React app.

3. Database Configuration:
 Use PostgreSQL as the database management system (DBMS).
 Set up the database schema to simulate real-world scenarios.

4. API Implementation:
 Develop RESTful API endpoints for interacting with the database.
 Implement multiple layers of security to prevent unauthorized access and SQL injection attacks.

5. Security Measures:
 Implement API validation to sanitize and validate incoming requests.
 User authentication and authorization for API access.
 Generate and maintain user credentials securely.
 Employ a comprehensive set of security measures to protect against SQL injection attacks.

6. Logging:
 Log all database updates and API interactions for analysis and audit purposes.
 Ensure logs are maintained securely and can be accessed by authorized personnel only.

7. Populating Database:
 Populate the database with dummy data to simulate real-world scenarios and test SQL injection vulnerabilities.
 Implement scripts for easy data generation and reloading.

8. Environment:
 Use Node.js and Express.js for API development.
 Employ best practices for code quality, documentation, and maintainability.
